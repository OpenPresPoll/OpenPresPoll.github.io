              Just select a candidate to vote for above. We'll
              automatically prefill a tweet that gets sent to
              <a href="https://twitter.com/openprespoll">@OpenPresPoll</a>, our
              Twitter bot.  If you prefer to keep your vote private,
              we'll instead send a direct message to our bot.  If you
              change your mind, just vote again. Only your latest vote
              counts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Twitter bot automatically looks through its mentions
              and DMs and records each vote into a database that is
              made available to the public. All usernames and IDs are
              obscured in the public database. If you made your vote
              privately, it is impossible for someone to discover your
              identity from the public database.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will regularly tweet out interesting
              graphs and statistics based on the current vote data.

          <h3 class="question">Why Are You Doing This?</h3>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              We've been really interested in this next election and
              especially what the polls are saying.  After looking
              through the existing polls we found a number of things
              wrong with them:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Small sample size: Most public opinion polls
                only ask about 500 to 1000 people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Excessively summarized: You can't arbitrarily drill down
                into the results to understand the more detailed trends.
              </li>
              <li>
                Opaque methods: How is this data even collected?
              </li>
              <li>
                Stale data: The results are out-of-date once they are released.
              </li>
              <li>
                Closed: The data isn't available for download for personal analysis.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These limitations severely limit the amount of useful insight
              that can be gained from opinion polls. It's really anyone's guess on who
              the public thinks the next president should be.
            </p>
            <p>
              We knew something better could exist so we created this platform to solve
              the problems with current polling methodology. With this platform,
              anyone in the world at any time can get an up-to-date and accurate
              picture of our poll results.

              Could you optionally provide some
